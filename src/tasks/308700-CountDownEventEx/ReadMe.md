- Barrier Class. Enables multiple tasks to cooperatively work on an algorithm in parallel through multiple phases.

- The second technique is to use a CancellationToken when creating the Tasks and use a version of the Barrier.SignalAndWait() method that takes a CancellationToken as an argument. 

- A selective continuation Task cancels the token, which causes calls to SignalAndWait() to throw an OperationCancelledException, stopping all of the Tasks from continuing. This technique works if you donâ€™t want any of the Tasks to continue if any of them throw an exception. 

- The example demonstrates this technique. Remember that the exception that was thrown in the first place is unhandled and will have to be dealt with.

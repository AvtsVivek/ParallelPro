- The ConcurrentBag class implements an unordered collection, such that the order in which items are added does not guarantee the order in which they will be returned.  

- Items are added with the Add() method, returned and removed from the collection with the TryTake() method, and returned without being removed with the TryPeek() method. 

- The example demonstrates use of the ConcurrentBag collection.
